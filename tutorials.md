I followed the Git Immersion tutorial. As a very new programmer and brand new to github, I found the tutorial could use some improvement.
Some small steps were left out that made it difficult to follow and complete everything correctly.
I was able to find a couple of youtube videos that showed the first few labs and that was helpful.
Once getting through the first 8 labs or so, it seemed to be easier to follow.
After this point there was some really useful information, and completing it helped to feel more comfortable using git.
